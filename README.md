# Bank-Personal-Loan-Prediction
The project is aimed at implementing a model(s) to predict likeliness of converting liability customers to personal loan customers.

•	Remove variables, build what is needed.

•	Models: Logistic Regression, KNN techniques, RandomForest, Ensemble Learning & Neural Networks.

•	Choose the best model having best accuracy.

## Business Problem:

This case is about a bank whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.

## Results:
Below is the accuracy for all the five models implemented in the project:

### MODEL	ACCURRACY

Logistic Regression	90.6 %

KNN	99.2%

RandomForest	99.2 %

Neural Networks	91.2 %

Ensemble	Voting: 99.2 %

Weighted: 99.2 %

KNN and RandomForest performed the best with an accuracy of 99.2% followed by Ensemble and with an accuracy of 99.2%.

## Summary:

The aim of the bank is to convert their liability customers into loan customers. They want to set up a new marketing campaign; hence, they need information about the connection between the variables given in the data. Four classification algorithms were used in this project. From the implementation, it seems like KNN have the highest accuracy and we can choose that as our final model.
